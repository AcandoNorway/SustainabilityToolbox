# Software Architecture

Feel free to copy the following chapter into your architecture document and elaborate it.

## SUSTAINABILITY

### Network Efficiency

Keywords: Size, distance, hops, energy efficiency, carbon intensity, network protocol

Current: TBD

Potential: TBD

### Demand Shaping

Demand shaping is the strategy of moving compute to regions or times when the carbon intensity is less, and also the strategy of constructing the user interface to lower resource use.

Keywords: Carbon-aware, carbon-efficient, eco-mode

Current: TBD

Potential: TBD

### Optimization

Keywords: Carbon, energy, cost, networking, performance

Current: TBD

Potential: TBD

#### Networking

Current: TBD

Potential: TBD

#### Energy & Cost

Keywords: Azure cost analysis per resource group or subscription, all environments, energy consumption

Current: TBD

Potential: TBD
